# Clerk Authentication Setup Instructions

## 1. Create a Clerk Account

1. Go to https://clerk.com and sign up for a free account
2. Create a new application
3. Choose your authentication methods (email/password, social logins, etc.)

## 2. Get Your API Keys

After creating your application, go to the API Keys section and copy:

- **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_`)
- **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_`)

## 3. Update Environment Variables

Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# URLs (keep these as they are)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/auth/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/auth/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

## 4. What's Been Implemented

### Authentication Pages:

- `/auth` - Landing page with options to sign in or sign up
- `/auth/sign-in` - Clerk's sign-in component
- `/auth/sign-up` - Clerk's sign-up component

### Protected Routes:

- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard after authentication
- `/user` - User dashboard with full features
- `/resumeEdit` - Resume editor (protected)

### Middleware Protection:

The `middleware.ts` file protects routes that require authentication.

### User Integration:

- User information is automatically fetched from Clerk
- UserButton component provides user menu and sign-out functionality
- Authentication state is managed globally

## 5. Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `/auth` to test sign-up/sign-in
3. After signing in, you'll be redirected to `/dashboard`
4. Try accessing protected routes without being signed in

## 6. Features Included

- Email/password authentication
- User profile management
- Protected routes
- Automatic redirects
- User session management
- Sign-out functionality

## 7. Next Steps
